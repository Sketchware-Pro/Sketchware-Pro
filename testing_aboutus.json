If some bugs are found, please send reports in the Discord server into #swpro-beta.\nIt's recommended to back up your .sketchware folder in case any bug âœ¨magicallyâœ¨ messes anything up.\n\nWhat's new?\n - Updated Create project backup dialog to fit better to Sketchware.\n - Support for scrolling in Build Settings and Project Configuration.\n - Automatic classpath-added directory for all projects: Find it in /Internal storage/.sketchware/data/<project ID>/files/classpath/.\n - AAPT2 as Resource Processor by default, and also, AAPT being removed. Its logic and binaries are still there for now.\n - Custom versions of generated files, such as FileUtil.java! Just create a file in a Manager named exactly as the one you want to replace, for example FileUtil.java in Java Manager or main.xml in Resource Manager at res/layout/.\n - (Under-the-hood) Speed improvements, as String#format(String, Object...) calls have been converted to \" + \"/StringBuilder + StringBuilder#append(String) in many code-generating classes.\n\nWhat's been fixed?\n - All new Local library Manager issues, as we've temporarily reverted it back to almost-v6.3.0 fix1 logic\n - A Glide artefact not getting added to the APK, that'd cause ClassDefNotFoundExceptions for com.bumptech.glide.gifdecoder.GifDecoder$BitmapProvider\n - New projects having 1.0.0 as Version Name\n - Extra Firebase Auth listener fields (ergo those not in vanilla Sketchware) not being added to Activities using a Firebase Auth Component\n\nKnown issues\n - No new ones! :DD\n\nImportant Firebase Database note\nAs it seems that not many people have read Public Beta 1's changelog, we'll just tell it again:\n - Firebase Database storage locations have been updated, and also in Sketchware Pro projects. You have to reconfigure the library for each project, and now, use the full Database URL without https:// at the start and / at the end as the Project ID. Example: whatever-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app\n\nLink\n > Find it in our Discord server.

      "description": "It's time for another major bugfix build! Now built projects should finally be working completely!\nThis build has an important fix for Android 11+ devices with Scoped storage enabled, so build time should be much shorter now.\nIt's recommended to back up your .sketchware folder in case any bug âœ¨magicallyâœ¨ messes anything up.\n\nWhat's new?\n - Android 11 storage change, which requires new special access. You should see the dialog either on startup or the 2nd one after granting storage permissions.\n - Removed Tutorials tab from MainActivity. It was empty anyway.\n\nWhat's been fixed?\n - Projects using an image load from URL or in general the Glide library should work again when trying to load GIFs. (49f3daf4638e8f56588e808030ad029afcbba04b)\n - \"About modders\" shouldn't crash anymore on devices without a browser. (6475fce889c9e19904ea9fc04cb70b2a4b876f46)\n - Projects using the built-in OneSignal component shouldn't fail at AndroidManifest.xml anymore! (5131e811f3a0e472f9dc3df2115cabcea4a295d0)\n - (Minor) repeat for (N) (variable name) block should now use a correct spec, re-place it from the blocks menu to update its spec. (11699ad0fddbdf7bc9d4fb407734fc87e38c9a95)\n - (Major) AAPT2 bug not creating its compiled built-in libraries resources directory. (0639250498189a2ff5b12c1fc239a3ea40b3a223)\n - Local library Manager shouldn't crash anymore while scrolling/refreshing libraries. (6bed60b3b3e98e0c27545ca8d792533ea43cf00e)\n(Last update: 2021-07-28T00:01:??Z+0200)\n\nKnown issues\n - Projects still using AAPT and with AppCompat turned on won't compile. That's an issue of some built-in libraries and AAPT being old/deprecated. It'll be removed until stable v6.4.0.\n - Local library Manager doesn't enable/disable libraries unless you leave the screen before the list item gets invisible.",

(Unstable, might break currently in use libraries.)\n- Swipe-to-refresh gesture in Local library Manager. (Unstable, might crash the activity.)\n- Updated experimental Java class renaming in Java Manager.\n- Install a previously built APK with ease! See the button next to RUN in DesignActivity.\n\nWhat's been fixed?\n - Command blocks work again! ðŸŽ‰\n- Build Settings doesn't show unused output format setting anymore.\n- The app now warns you when trying to export an AAB on a not-Android 8+ device.\n- Exporting a project shouldn't crash Sketchware Pro anymore. Note that it still misses imported resources!\n - DEX files get merged properly again, finally usable projects again!\n- DesignActivity and ExportProjectActivity don't crash on pre-API 23 devices anymore.\n\nKnown issues\n - Local library Manager might crash when refreshing libraries often, also sometimes turning them on or off might not work.\n(Last update: 2021-07-23T16:06:??Z+0200)",

You'll have to reconfigure it for each project, and now use the full URL without https:// at the start and / at the end. Example: whatever-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app\n\nKnown issues:\n - (Critical) Command Blocks aren't working.\n - Build Settings still shows up AAB output, even if it won't work.

These blocks can be used anywhere in your logic editor, there is no specific place (event) for them. They can be used to achieve tasks such as:\n- Remove onActivityResult entirely, or change its code, or add more codes to it.\n- Implement interfaces in your activity (remove/change any part of code that sketchware automatically generates.\n- Modify any part of root layout, add multiple fabs, change coordinatorLayout to FrameLayout, RelativeLayout. Change the order of root layout..\n- Inject codes in onCreate or anywhere you like... etc (supports all Java files and XML files. including AndroidManifest, styles, colors and strings.xml).\n\n\n- Changed the built-in Code Editor to a super optimized one. this new one has features such as:\n- Auto completion, various themes, pinch-to-zoom, undo-redo, find&replace etc.\n- Added built-in Backup/Restore feature that provides a function to back up your project (.swb), along with the local libs and custom blocks you used.\n- Updated android.jar to API 30.\n- Local Library improvements.. now, in your local libs you can:\n- Use assets, proguard rules, native libs, multiple dex files, Java8 libraries.\n- Library Downloader can now download Java8 libraries.\n- Added ProGuard Full Mode (includes local libs in ProGuarding process)\n- Added Custom Blocks analyzer dialog that shows you the custom blocks you used in your project.\n- New Block system optimizations.
