### Commit message
When you've made changes to one or more files, you have to *commit* that file. You also need a *message* for that *commit*.

You should read these guidelines: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/

And that summarized:
 - Short and detailed
 - Prefix one of these commit types:
   - `feat:` A feature, possibly improving something already existing
   - `fix:` A fix, for example of a bug
   - `style:` Feature and updates related to styling
   - `refactor:` Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
   - `test:` Everything related to testing
   - `docs:` Everything related to documentation
   - `chore:` Code maintenance (you can also use emojis to represent commit types)

Examples:
 - `feat: Added a new technique to speed up compiling`
 - `fix: Fixed crash when the app starts on certain phones`
 - `refactor: Reformatted code at File.java`

## Thanks for contributing
Thanks, they help to keep **Sketchware Pro** alive. It's better to have multiple people work on a project, for more ideas, less bugs
(sadly sometimes more), and generally quicker development. Each (helpful) contribution that gets thankfully accepted,
gets noted down in the "About Modders" activity. We'll contact you how to note your contributions to Sketchware Pro.
