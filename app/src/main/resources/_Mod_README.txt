DISCLAIMER: This mod was not meant for any harmful purposes, such as harming Sketchware; Quite the opposite actually: It was made to keep Sketchware alive.
Please use it on your own discretion and buy the Sketchware Premium subscription every month to support the original Sketchware team, even if you don't use it. 

We love Sketchware very much, and we are grateful to Sketchware's developers for making such an amazing app,
but unfortunately, we haven't received updates for a long time.
That's why we decided to keep Sketchware alive by making this mod, plus we don't demand any money - It's completely free :)
Also, starting with version 6.4.0 of the Mod, we've made some source code open source! You can check it out at https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/,
and if you want to contribute, go fork it and open a pull request! We'd love to see new amazing features getting added to Sketchware Pro :D

★ The change log can be found in the mod's Main Drawer.

**** FOR MODDERS ****

I made this part specifically for my fellow modders who want to contribute to Sketchware Pro's development. Think of it as a little documentation :)

     and, Sketchware's most important classes that are modified for the Mod, including:
       Fx -> Responsible for generating the code of each block. Cannot be decompiled properly due to its HUGE size, you may want to edit this one by smali.
       Jx -> Responsible for generating the source code of activities.
       Lx -> Responsible for generating source codes of stuff such as listeners etc.
       Ox -> Responsible for generating the XML source of layouts.

   classes6.dex -> This one is all about the compilation. Contains ProGuard, StringFog handler classes/activities, and:
       Dp -> Responsible for the whole compilation process of projects. Was modified to fix MultiDex bug and to add library support.
       yq -> Organizes Sketchware projects' file paths.
       
   classes7.dex -> Contains both ProGuard and d8/r8
   
   classes8.dex -> Contains some dependencies of bundletool, this is the only DEX supposed to be of version 038!
