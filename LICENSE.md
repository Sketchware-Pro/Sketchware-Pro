# License

It's a complicated situation as mod. Basically, try not to use parts of Sketchware Pro's code in other serious projects which
aren't for personal use only, as the code might and probably is an infringement of Sketchware's copyright.

Sketchware Pro is **not** open-source by official definition, but rather source-available - you can view it, and maybe even
make/submit changes to it, but you don't own the code. Neither do we, in my opinion.

Still, feel free to fork this and improve it for personal purposes or just making Sketchware Pro better in general.

## Exceptions

Since compiling Kotlin code in Sketchware Pro projects was supported, two new modules were added to the codebase: `build-logic` and
`kotlinc`, both taken from [CodeAssist](https://github.com/tyron12233/CodeAssist). The upstream project's licensed under GPL-3.0,
so these modules are licensed under the same license.
